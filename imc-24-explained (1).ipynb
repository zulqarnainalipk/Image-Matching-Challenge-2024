    "# 📷 Creating the Cameras Table in SQL 🛠️\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Table Creation Statement**:\n",
    "   - The provided SQL statement is used to create a table named `cameras` if it doesn't already exist. This ensures that running the script multiple times won't result in errors due to the table already existing.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cameras (\n",
    "       camera_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,\n",
    "       model INTEGER NOT NULL,\n",
    "       width INTEGER NOT NULL,\n",
    "       height INTEGER NOT NULL,\n",
    "       params BLOB,\n",
    "       prior_focal_length INTEGER NOT NULL\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Table Columns**:\n",
    "   - **`camera_id`**: \n",
    "     - `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL`: This defines the `camera_id` as the primary key for the table. It will automatically increment with each new entry, ensuring a unique identifier for each record.\n",
    "   - **`model`**:\n",
    "     - `INTEGER NOT NULL`: This column stores the model number of the camera, ensuring it's an integer and cannot be null.\n",
    "   - **`width`**:\n",
    "     - `INTEGER NOT NULL`: This column stores the width of the camera's image sensor or resolution, ensuring it's an integer and cannot be null.\n",
    "   - **`height`**:\n",
    "     - `INTEGER NOT NULL`: This column stores the height of the camera's image sensor or resolution, ensuring it's an integer and cannot be null.\n",
    "   - **`params`**:\n",
    "     - `BLOB`: This column stores additional parameters for the camera in binary large object format. BLOB is used to store data such as images, multimedia, and other large data types.\n",
    "   - **`prior_focal_length`**:\n",
    "     - `INTEGER NOT NULL`: This column stores the prior focal length of the camera, ensuring it's an integer and cannot be null.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Concepts**:\n",
    "   - **SQL Data Types**:\n",
    "     - **INTEGER**: Used to store whole numbers.\n",
    "     - **PRIMARY KEY**: A unique identifier for table records. `AUTOINCREMENT` ensures each new record gets a unique value automatically.\n",
    "     - **NOT NULL**: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.\n",
    "     - **BLOB**: Stands for Binary Large Object, used to store large amounts of binary data.\n",
    "   - **SQL Table Creation**:\n",
    "     - `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`: Ensures that the table creation command does not fail if the table already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Study Sources\n",
    "\n",

    "# 🔄 Converting Pair ID to Image IDs in Python 🔢\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Purpose**:\n",
    "   - The function `pair_id_to_image_ids` takes a `pair_id` and converts it back to the original image IDs (`image_id1` and `image_id2`). This is the reverse operation of the `image_ids_to_pair_id` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parameter and Return**:\n",
    "   - **Parameter**:\n",
    "     - `pair_id`: An integer that uniquely identifies a pair of image IDs.\n",
    "   - **Return**:\n",
    "     - A tuple containing two integers: `image_id1` and `image_id2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Steps in the Function**:\n",
    "   - **Calculate `image_id2`**:\n",
    "     - `image_id2 = pair_id % MAX_IMAGE_ID`: This line calculates `image_id2` by taking the modulus of `pair_id` with `MAX_IMAGE_ID`. The modulus operation returns the remainder when `pair_id` is divided by `MAX_IMAGE_ID`, effectively isolating `image_id2`.\n",
    "   - **Calculate `image_id1`**:\n",
    "     - `image_id1 = (pair_id - image_id2) / MAX_IMAGE_ID`: This line calculates `image_id1` by subtracting `image_id2` from `pair_id` and then dividing the result by `MAX_IMAGE_ID`. This isolates `image_id1`.\n",
    "   - **Return the Image IDs**:\n",
    "     - `return image_id1, image_id2`: This returns the tuple of `image_id1` and `image_id2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Concepts**:\n",
    "   - **Modulus Operator (`%`)**:\n",
    "     - The modulus operator returns the remainder of a division operation. It's useful for breaking down numbers, particularly in encoding and decoding schemes.\n",
    "   - **Integer Division (`/`)**:\n",
    "     - In Python 3, the division operator (`/`) returns a float. For integer division that truncates towards zero, you would typically use `//`, but here we use `/` since `pair_id` was constructed using multiplication, which naturally results in an integer outcome when reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Edge Cases**:\n",
    "   - This function assumes that `pair_id` was generated using the `image_ids_to_pair_id` function and thus `image_id1` will always be less than or equal to `image_id2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Study Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modulus Operator**:\n",
    "   - Understanding the modulus operator is essential for various algorithms, particularly those involving cyclical structures and encoding/decoding.\n",

    "# 🛠️ Converting Array to BLOB in Python 📦\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Purpose**:\n",
    "   - The function `array_to_blob` converts a NumPy array to a binary large object (BLOB). This is useful for storing arrays in a database as BLOBs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parameter and Return**:\n",
    "   - **Parameter**:\n",
    "     - `array`: A NumPy array that needs to be converted to a BLOB.\n",
    "   - **Return**:\n",
    "     - A binary representation of the NumPy array, suitable for storage as a BLOB.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Python Version Check**:\n",
    "   - The function uses a global variable `IS_PYTHON3` to check if the Python version is 3 or higher. This variable should be defined elsewhere in the code, typically as:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     IS_PYTHON3 = sys.version_info[0] >= 3\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Python 3**:\n",
    "     - `array.tostring()`: In Python 3, this method converts the array to a string of bytes. Note that `tostring()` is deprecated in favor of `tobytes()` in recent versions of NumPy.\n",
    "   - **Python 2**:\n",
    "     - `np.getbuffer(array)`: In Python 2, this method converts the array to a buffer object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Study Sources\n",

    "# 📝 Example Usage of COLMAP Database Management with SQLite 🗄️\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition: `example_usage`**\n",
    "   - This function demonstrates the use of the `COLMAPDatabase` class to create and manipulate a COLMAP database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Imports and Argument Parsing**\n",
    "   - Import necessary modules: `os`, `argparse`, `numpy`.\n",
    "   - **Argument Parsing**: Define and parse the command-line argument `--database_path` with a default value of `\"database.db\"`.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n",
    "     parser.add_argument(\"--database_path\", default=\"database.db\")\n",
    "     args, unknown = parser.parse_known_args()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Database Path Check**\n",
    "   - Check if the database path already exists to avoid overwriting an existing database.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     if os.path.exists(args.database_path):\n",
    "         print(\"ERROR: database path already exists -- will not modify it.\")\n",
    "         return\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Database Connection and Table Creation**\n",
    "   - Establish a connection to the database and create all required tables.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     db = COLMAPDatabase.connect(args.database_path)\n",
    "     db.create_tables()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",

    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Adding Images**\n",
    "   - Create dummy image entries and add them to the database.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     image_id1 = db.add_image(\"image1.png\", camera_id1)\n",

    "     image_id4 = db.add_image(\"image4.png\", camera_id2)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Adding Keypoints**\n",
    "   - Create and add random keypoints associated with each image.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     num_keypoints = 1000\n",
    "     keypoints1 = np.random.rand(num_keypoints, 2) * (width1, height1)\n",

    "     db.add_matches(image_id3, image_id4, matches34)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Commit and Verification**\n",
    "   - Commit changes to the database.\n",

    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`IMC_PATH` Variable**:\n",
    "   - `IMC_PATH` is a string variable that holds the path to the directory where the data for the Image Matching Challenge of 2024 is located.\n",
    "   - This variable is used to specify the location of datasets, images, or other relevant files needed for the Image Matching Challenge tasks.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **`DEVICE` Variable**:\n",
    "   - `DEVICE` is a variable that determines the device on which PyTorch operations will be performed.\n",
    "   - It checks if a CUDA-enabled GPU is available using `torch.cuda.is_available()`.\n",
    "   - If a GPU is available, `DEVICE` is set to \"cuda\", indicating that operations should be performed on the GPU for faster computation.\n",
    "   - If a GPU is not available, `DEVICE` is set to \"cpu\", indicating that operations will be performed on the CPU.\n",
    "   - This ensures that the code can adapt to different computing environments, leveraging GPU acceleration when available for faster computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`clear_output(wait=False)`**:\n",
    "   - This function call is likely used to clear the output of the cell, making the notebook output cleaner.\n",
    "   - The `wait=False` parameter ensures that the output is cleared immediately without waiting for other cell executions to complete.\n",

    "# 🔄 Rotating Image Using PyTorch 🖼️\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This function `rotate_image` rotates an image by a multiple of 90 degrees using a PyTorch model for rotation prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Signature**:\n",
    "   - `rotate_image(image, rotation)`: This function takes two parameters:\n",
    "     - `image`: The input image tensor to be rotated.\n",
    "     - `rotation`: A PyTorch model that predicts the rotation angle of the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Image Rotation Process**:\n",
    "   - The function iterates four times (equivalent to 360 degrees) to cover all possible rotations.\n",
    "   - For each iteration, it uses the provided rotation model to predict the rotation angle of the input image.\n",
    "   - If the predicted rotation angle is 0 (indicating no rotation needed), the loop breaks, and the original image is returned.\n",
    "   - If a non-zero rotation angle is predicted, the image is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise using the `rot90` function.\n",
    "   - This process continues until either a rotation of 0 degrees is predicted or all four iterations are completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`torch.no_grad()` Context Manager**:\n",
    "   - The `with torch.no_grad():` context manager is used to ensure that no gradient calculations are performed during inference.\n",
    "   - This is beneficial for inference-only operations, as it reduces memory consumption and speeds up computation by avoiding unnecessary gradient tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output**:\n",
    "   - The function returns the rotated image tensor.\n",

    "# 🔍 Image Overlap Detection with Feature Matching 🖼️\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This function `overlap_detection` detects the overlap region between two images using feature extraction and matching techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Signature**:\n",
    "   - `overlap_detection(extractor, matcher, image0, image1, min_matches)`: This function takes five parameters:\n",
    "     - `extractor`: A feature extractor model used to extract features from the images.\n",
    "     - `matcher`: A feature matcher model used to match features between the images.\n",
    "     - `image0`: The first input image tensor.\n",
    "     - `image1`: The second input image tensor.\n",
    "     - `min_matches`: The minimum number of matches required to consider the overlap valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction and Matching**:\n",
    "   - The function first extracts features from both input images using the provided `extractor` model.\n",
    "   - It then matches the extracted features between the two images using the `matcher` model.\n",
    "   - If the number of matches is less than `min_matches`, the function returns the extracted features and matches without further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bounding Box Calculation**:\n",
    "   - If the number of matches is sufficient, the function calculates the bounding boxes for the matched keypoints in both images.\n",
    "   - It finds the minimum and maximum coordinates of the matched keypoints in each image and calculates the width and height of the bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Image Cropping**:\n",
    "   - Using the calculated bounding boxes, the function crops the overlapping regions from both images.\n",
    "   - It then calls the `match_pair` function (not provided here) to re-match features in the cropped regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Adjusting Keypoint Coordinates**:\n",
    "   - After matching features in the cropped regions, the function adjusts the coordinates of the keypoints to match the original image coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output**:\n",

    "# 📝 Converting Array to String Representation 🔄\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This function `arr_to_str` converts a NumPy array to a string representation by flattening it and joining its elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Signature**:\n",
    "   - `arr_to_str(a)`: This function takes one parameter:\n",
    "     - `a`: The input NumPy array to be converted to a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flattening the Array**:\n",
    "   - The function first reshapes the input array `a` using `.reshape(-1)`, which flattens the array into a 1-dimensional shape.\n",
    "   - This ensures that regardless of the input array's dimensions, it will be converted to a 1D array.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Joining Array Elements**:\n",
    "   - The flattened array elements are then converted to strings using a list comprehension `[str(x) for x in a.reshape(-1)]`.\n",
    "   - Each element is converted to a string to prepare for joining.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Joining with Separator**:\n",
    "   - The `join` method is used to concatenate the string representations of array elements into a single string.\n",
    "   - A semicolon (`;`) is used as the separator to distinguish between individual elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Returning String Representation**:\n",
    "   - The function returns the concatenated string representation of the input array.\n",

    "# 📄 Creating Submission File from Results 🖋️\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This function `create_submission` generates a submission CSV file based on the results obtained from processing the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Signature**:\n",
    "   - `create_submission(results, data_dict, base_path)`: This function takes three parameters:\n",
    "     - `results`: A dictionary containing the processed results, typically obtained from some analysis or computation.\n",
    "     - `data_dict`: A dictionary containing information about the dataset and scenes.\n",
    "     - `base_path`: The base path to be used for constructing relative paths of image files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Writing Header**:\n",
    "   - The function opens the submission file in write mode and writes the header line containing column names: `\"image_path,dataset,scene,rotation_matrix,translation_vector\\n\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterating Over Datasets and Scenes**:\n",
    "   - It iterates over each dataset in the `data_dict`.\n",
    "   - For each dataset, it checks if corresponding results are available in the `results` dictionary. If not, it initializes an empty dictionary.\n",
    "   - It then iterates over each scene in the dataset and checks if scene-specific results are available. If not, it initializes empty dictionaries for rotation (`R`) and translation (`t`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Writing Data to CSV**:\n",
    "   - For each image in the dataset and scene, it retrieves the rotation matrix (`R`) and translation vector (`t`) from the results. If not available, it defaults to identity matrix and zero vector, respectively.\n",
    "   - It constructs the relative image path with respect to the `base_path`.\n",
    "   - It writes the image path, dataset, scene, rotation matrix, and translation vector to the CSV file.\n",

    "# Vector Norm Calculation 📐\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This function `vector_norm` computes the Euclidean norm (or length) of a numpy array. The Euclidean norm is the standard length of a vector and is computed as the square root of the sum of the squared elements. This function can handle both 1-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays, and allows specifying the axis along which to compute the norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "   - The function `vector_norm` takes three parameters:\n",
    "     - `data`: The input array whose norm is to be calculated.\n",
    "     - `axis`: The axis along which to compute the norm. If `None`, the norm is computed over the entire array.\n",
    "     - `out`: An optional output array to store the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conversion to Numpy Array**:\n",
    "   - The input `data` is converted to a numpy array of type `float64` to ensure precision in calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling 1D Arrays**:\n",
    "   - If the input array is 1-dimensional and `out` is `None`, the norm is calculated using `np.dot` to compute the dot product of the array with itself, followed by taking the square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling Multi-Dimensional Arrays**:\n",
    "   - For multi-dimensional arrays, the elements of the array are squared, and the sum is computed along the specified axis.\n",
    "   - If `out` is `None`, the sum of the squared elements is stored in a new array, `out`, and the square root of this array is returned.\n",
    "   - If `out` is provided, the result is stored in the provided output array after summing the squared elements and taking the square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **In-Place Operations**:\n",
    "   - The operations are performed in-place when `out` is provided to avoid creating additional copies of the data, making the function more memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 1: 1D array\n",
    "vector = np.array([3, 4])\n",
    "print(vector_norm(vector))  # Output: 5.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2: 2D array, norm along rows (axis=1)\n",
    "matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "print(vector_norm(matrix, axis=1))  # Output: [3.74165739 8.77496439]\n",

    "# Quaternion to Homogeneous Rotation Matrix Conversion 🔄\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This function, `quaternion_matrix`, converts a quaternion into a homogeneous rotation matrix. Quaternions are often used in computer graphics, robotics, and aerospace for representing rotations because they are more numerically stable and efficient compared to other representations like Euler angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "   - The function `quaternion_matrix` takes a single parameter:\n",
    "     - `quaternion`: A 4-element array representing the quaternion (q0, q1, q2, q3).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conversion to Numpy Array**:\n",
    "   - The input quaternion is converted to a numpy array of type `float64` for precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Normalization Check**:\n",
    "   - The norm (squared magnitude) of the quaternion is computed.\n",
    "   - If the norm is very small (less than a tiny threshold `_EPS`), the function returns the identity matrix. This is a special case to handle quaternions that are essentially zero, which represents no rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normalization and Scaling**:\n",
    "   - The quaternion is scaled by the square root of \\(2/n\\) to ensure it is normalized. This scaling factor ensures that the resulting rotation matrix is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Outer Product Calculation**:\n",
    "   - The outer product of the quaternion with itself is computed to form a 4x4 matrix. This matrix is used in the construction of the rotation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Rotation Matrix Construction**:\n",
    "   - The elements of the 4x4 homogeneous rotation matrix are populated using the elements of the outer product matrix. This matrix includes both the rotation (top-left 3x3 submatrix) and homogeneous transformation (last column and row).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example quaternion (unit quaternion representing no rotation)\n",
    "quaternion = [1, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert quaternion to rotation matrix\n",

    "# Affine Transformation Matrix from Point Correspondences ✨\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This function, `affine_matrix_from_points`, computes an affine transformation matrix that maps points in `v0` to corresponding points in `v1`. Affine transformations include translation, scaling, rotation, and shearing. The function supports options for including or excluding shearing and scaling in the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "   - The function `affine_matrix_from_points` takes the following parameters:\n",
    "     - `v0`: A set of source points.\n",
    "     - `v1`: A set of destination points.\n",
    "     - `shear`: A boolean flag to include/exclude shearing in the transformation.\n",
    "     - `scale`: A boolean flag to include/exclude scaling in the transformation.\n",
    "     - `usesvd`: A boolean flag to use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Validation**:\n",
    "   - The function checks if the input arrays have the correct shape and type. If the conditions are not met, it raises a `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Moving Centroids to Origin**:\n",
    "   - The centroids of `v0` and `v1` are calculated and subtracted from the points to move the centroids to the origin. This step simplifies the computation of the transformation matrix.\n",
    "   - Transformation matrices `M0` and `M1` are created to move the centroids back to their original positions later.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Affine Transformation**:\n",
    "   - If `shear` is enabled, the function computes the affine transformation using SVD on the concatenated matrices of `v0` and `v1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Rigid Transformation via SVD**:\n",
    "   - If `shear` is disabled or `usesvd` is enabled, the function computes the rigid transformation using SVD on the covariance matrix of `v1` and `v0`. The resulting rotation matrix `R` is used to form the transformation matrix `M`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Rigid Transformation via Quaternion**:\n",
    "   - If `usesvd` is disabled and the dimension is not 3, the function computes the rigid transformation using quaternion. It constructs a symmetric matrix `N`, computes its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and forms the rotation matrix from the unit quaternion.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Scaling**:\n",
    "   - If `scale` is enabled and `shear` is disabled, the function applies scaling by adjusting the transformation matrix based on the ratio of RMS deviations from the centroids of `v0` and `v1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Moving Centroids Back**:\n",
    "   - The function moves the centroids back to their original positions by multiplying the transformation matrices `M0` and `M1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Normalization**:\n",
    "   - The transformation matrix `M` is normalized to ensure the last element is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Return**:\n",
    "    - The function returns the final transformation matrix `M`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",

    "# IMC 3D Error Metric: Register by Horn Method 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This function, `register_by_Horn`, performs registration of estimated camera coordinates (`ev_coord`) to ground truth camera coordinates (`gt_coord`) using an iterative process involving RANSAC and affine transformation. The goal is to find the best transformation matrix that minimizes the error between the estimated and ground truth coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "   - The function `register_by_Horn` takes the following parameters:\n",
    "     - `ev_coord`: Estimated camera coordinates.\n",
    "     - `gt_coord`: Ground truth camera coordinates.\n",
    "     - `ransac_threshold`: Thresholds for RANSAC inlier detection.\n",
    "     - `inl_cf`: Inlier coefficient for refining the transformation.\n",
    "     - `strict_cf`: Strict coefficient for determining strict inliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Remove Invalid Cameras**:\n",
    "   - Cameras with non-finite coordinates are removed from consideration. The indices of valid cameras are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Several variables are initialized to keep track of the best transformation matrix, errors, and inliers.\n",
    "   - `max_no_inl`: Maximum number of inliers for each RANSAC threshold.\n",
    "   - `best_inl_err`: Best inlier error for each RANSAC threshold.\n",
    "   - `best_transf_matrix`: Best transformation matrix for each RANSAC threshold.\n",
    "   - `best_err`: Best error for each camera and RANSAC threshold.\n",
    "   - `strict_inl`: Boolean array indicating strict inliers.\n",
    "   - `triplets_used`: Indices of the camera triplets used for the best transformation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run on Camera Triplets**:\n",
    "   - The function iterates over all possible triplets of camera indices. For each triplet:\n",
    "     - If all three cameras are already strict inliers for the best current model, the triplet is skipped.\n",
    "     - An affine transformation matrix is computed using the `affine_matrix_from_points` function.\n",
    "     - The transformation is applied to the estimated camera coordinates.\n",
    "     - The error between the transformed estimated coordinates and ground truth coordinates is computed.\n",
    "     - Inliers are identified based on the error and RANSAC thresholds.\n",
    "     - If the number of inliers for the current triplet is close to the best model so far, the transformation is refined using all inliers.\n",
    "     - The refined transformation matrix and inliers are used to update the best model if they provide a better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Best Model**:\n",
    "   - The best model is stored in a dictionary containing:\n",
    "     - `valid_cams`: Indices of valid cameras.\n",
    "     - `no_inl`: Number of inliers for each RANSAC threshold.\n",
    "     - `err`: Error for each camera and RANSAC threshold.\n",
    "     - `triplets_used`: Indices of the camera triplets used for the best transformation matrix.\n",
    "     - `transf_matrix`: Best transformation matrix for each RANSAC threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Return**:\n",
    "   - The function returns the best model found.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example estimated and ground truth coordinates\n",
    "ev_coord = np.random.rand(3, 10)  # 3D coordinates for 10 cameras\n",
    "gt_coord = np.random.rand(3, 10)  # 3D ground truth coordinates for 10 cameras\n",
    "\n",
    "# RANSAC parameters\n",
    "ransac_threshold = np.array([0.01, 0.02, 0.05])\n",
    "inl_cf = 1.2\n",
    "strict_cf = 0.8\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compute the best registration model\n",
    "best_model = register_by_Horn(ev_coord, gt_coord, ransac_threshold, inl_cf, strict_cf)\n",

    "# Mean Average Accuracy (mAA) on Cameras ✨\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `mAA_on_cameras` calculates the mean average accuracy (mAA) metric for camera registration errors over a range of thresholds. This metric evaluates the accuracy of camera positions after applying a registration algorithm, using specified error thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "   - The function `mAA_on_cameras` takes the following parameters:\n",
    "     - `err`: A 2D array of shape `(n, t)` containing errors for `n` cameras and `t` thresholds.\n",
    "     - `thresholds`: A list or array of error thresholds.\n",
    "     - `n`: The number of cameras.\n",
    "     - `skip_top_thresholds`: The number of top thresholds to skip in the calculation.\n",
    "     - `to_dec`: A constant for adjusting the number of cameras to consider (default is 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute Auxiliary Matrix**:\n",
    "   - The function creates a boolean matrix `aux`, which indicates whether each error value in `err` is below the corresponding threshold from `thresholds`, starting from `skip_top_thresholds`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate mAA**:\n",
    "   - The function calculates the mAA by summing the number of thresholds each camera's error is below, adjusted by `to_dec`.\n",
    "   - The sum is divided by the total number of considered thresholds (`len(thresholds[skip_top_thresholds:])`) and the adjusted number of cameras `(n - to_dec)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return**:\n",
    "   - The function returns the mAA value, representing the average accuracy of the camera positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example errors and thresholds\n",
    "errors = np.random.rand(10, 5)  # Errors for 10 cameras and 5 thresholds\n",
    "thresholds = [0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2]\n",
    "n = 10\n",
    "skip_top_thresholds = 1\n",
    "to_dec = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compute mAA\n",
    "maa_value = mAA_on_cameras(errors, thresholds, n, skip_top_thresholds, to_dec)\n",
    "print(\"Mean Average Accuracy:\", maa_value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thresholds**:\n",
    "   - The error thresholds are used to determine if a camera's error is acceptable. Lower thresholds mean stricter accuracy requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Auxiliary Matrix**:\n",
    "   - This boolean matrix `aux` helps identify which cameras have errors below the specified thresholds. It's created by comparing each error in `err` to the corresponding threshold in `thresholds`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mean Average Accuracy (mAA)**:\n",
    "   - mAA is a performance metric that averages the number of times errors fall below given thresholds, adjusted by `to_dec`. It provides an overall measure of registration accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **3D Reconstruction**: Evaluating the accuracy of reconstructed camera positions.\n",
    "- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: Assessing the precision of camera localization in SLAM algorithms.\n",
    "- **Augmented Reality**: Ensuring accurate camera placement in augmented reality environments.\n",

    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `get_camera_centers_from_df` extracts the camera centers from a given DataFrame. The DataFrame contains columns with the rotation matrix and translation vector for each image, and the function computes the camera center for each image using these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "   - The function `get_camera_centers_from_df` takes a single parameter `df`, which is a pandas DataFrame containing the following columns:\n",

    "# Function to Generate Image Pairs for Matching 🖼️🔍\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_pairs` function generates pairs of images from a list of images for matching. It considers two modes of operation: exhaustive and non-exhaustive.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exhaustive Mode**:\n",
    "   - If the `EXHAUSTIVE` flag is set to `True`, the function generates all possible combinations of image pairs using `itertools.combinations`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-exhaustive Mode**:\n",
    "   - If the flag is set to `False`, the function extracts features from each image using a pre-trained DINOv2 model.\n",
    "   - It computes embeddings for each image and calculates pairwise distances between embeddings.\n",
    "   - Image pairs with distances below a threshold (`DISTANCES_THRESHOLD`) are considered potential matches.\n",
    "   - To ensure a minimum number of pairs (`MIN_PAIRS`) for each image, additional pairs are selected based on distance rankings.\n",
    "   - Pairs with distances above a tolerance level (`TOLERANCE`) are filtered out.\n",
    "   - The function returns a list of unique pairs of indices representing matching image pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Input**:\n",
    "   - `images_list`: A list of image paths.\n",
    "   - `device`: The device (CPU or GPU) to use for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output**:\n",
    "   - A list of tuples representing pairs of indices, where each tuple contains two indices indicating the positions of matching images in the input list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example usage with a list of image paths\n",
    "images_list = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg', 'image3.jpg']\n",

    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Extraction with DINOv2**:\n",
    "   - The function utilizes a pre-trained DINOv2 model to extract embeddings from images.\n",
    "   - These embeddings represent the features of each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pairwise Distance Calculation**:\n",
    "   - It computes pairwise distances between the embeddings of all images.\n",
    "   - Images with distances below a certain threshold are considered potential matches.\n",

    "3. **Filtering and Ranking**:\n",
    "   - The function filters out pairs with distances above a tolerance level.\n",
    "   - It ensures a minimum number of pairs for each image by selecting additional pairs based on distance rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimization**:\n",

    "# Matching Keypoints between Images 📸🔑\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The `keypoints_matches` function matches keypoints between pairs of images from a list of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Extraction and Matching**:\n",
    "   - It utilizes ALIKED for keypoint detection and LightGlueMatcher for matching keypoints between images.\n",
    "   - The function first extracts keypoints and descriptors for each image using ALIKED.\n",
    "   - It then matches descriptors between pairs of images using LightGlueMatcher.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Creating and Storing Keypoints and Descriptors**:\n",
    "   - Keypoints and descriptors are saved in separate HDF5 files (`keypoints.h5` and `descriptors.h5`).\n",
    "   - Each image's keypoints and descriptors are stored under their respective image names in the HDF5 files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Storing Matches**:\n",
    "   - Matches between keypoints of image pairs are stored in another HDF5 file (`matches.h5`).\n",
    "   - For each pair of images, if the number of matches exceeds a minimum threshold (`MIN_MATCHES`), the indices of matched keypoints are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- `images_list`: A list of image paths.\n",
    "- `pairs`: A list of tuples representing pairs of indices of matching images.\n",

    "#### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keypoints, descriptors, and matches are stored in HDF5 files (`keypoints.h5`, `descriptors.h5`, and `matches.h5`, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Example usage with a list of image paths and pairs of matching images\n",

    "   - ALIKED is used for keypoint detection and description, providing robust feature extraction.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Keypoint Matching**:\n",
    "   - LightGlueMatcher performs matching between keypoints of different images based on their descriptors.\n",
    "   - Matches are stored as indices of keypoints in the HDF5 file.\n",

    "3. **Efficient Storage**:\n",
    "   - HDF5 format is utilized for efficient storage of keypoints, descriptors, and matches.\n",

    "   - Keypoints are added to the COLMAP database along with their descriptors.\n",
    "   - Matches between keypoints are computed and added to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matching and Reconstruction**:\n",
    "   - Exhaustive matching is performed using SIFT features.\n",
    "   - Incremental mapping is executed to generate a sparse reconstruction of the scene.\n",
    "   - The resulting reconstructions are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output**:\n",
    "   - The function returns the sparse reconstructions generated by COLMAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "- `images_path`: Path to the directory containing images to be reconstructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sparse reconstructions of the scene obtained from COLMAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example usage with the path to the directory containing images\n",
    "images_path = '/path/to/images/directory'\n",
    "sparse_reconstructions = ransac_and_sparse_reconstruction(images_path)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)**:\n",
    "   - RANSAC is utilized for robust estimation of geometric transformations from noisy data.\n",
    "   - It helps in identifying reliable matches between keypoints despite outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sparse Reconstruction**:\n",
    "   - COLMAP performs sparse reconstruction by estimating the 3D structure of the scene from images.\n",
    "   - It generates a set of sparse 3D points and camera poses, representing the scene geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Incremental Mapping**:\n",
    "   - COLMAP's incremental mapping algorithm incrementally adds images and performs bundle adjustment to refine the scene structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficient Database Management**:\n",
    "   - COLMAP database efficiently manages keypoints, matches, and other data structures required for reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
